				<h1>What is CTF?</h1>
				<p>No, we're not running around in a gym, tagging other players. Capture the flag contests, or CTFs for short, are intense cybersecurity contests where participants try to capture a piece of information. To do this, they must use skills to capture a virtual flag, usually taking the form of a string, like this: flag{this_is_a_flag}.</p>
				<p>EasyCTF is a CTF that's tailored for the high school level. Started by high school students, it was created with a passion for learning. We reach out to students and teachers all over the country in order to share our love for computer science for everyone.</p>
				<p>There are two common types of CTF competitions: jeopardy, and attack-defense. In a jeopardy-style CTF like EasyCTF, participants are tested on their security skills in the form of web, binary exploitation, forensics, cryptography, and reverse-engineering challenges. In EasyCTF, we also have an additional category, Programming, for people who aren't quite ready to dive into the deep end of the pool yet.</p>

				<h2>How can I prepare?</h2>
				<p>The best way to get better at CTFs is to play more CTFs! Make sure you read the writeups (solutions) for the problems you didn't solve, after the CTF is over. You can find writeups for many past CTFs at these <a href="https://github.com/ctfs" target="_blank">Github repos</a>.</p>
				<p>You can also find a helpful schedule of upcoming CTFs (on the high school level) at our <a href="http://calendar.easyctf.com" target="_blank">calendar</a>.

				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>EasyCTF is held every year at the end of the year, around November to December. This year, it will be held from <b>November 26</b> to <b>December 3</b>, 2016. Mark that week on your calendar!</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, the 2015 site has been removed until further notice. Participants who wish to try the problems from this year are encouraged to try them <a href="https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2015/tree/master/easyctf-2015" target="_blank">here</a> instead. The shell and programming judge will probably not be revived.</p>

				<h1>Sponsorship</h1>
				<p>We'd love to work with you! If you're a school or a company that's interested in working with EasyCTF, shoot us an email!</p>
